# install Jenkins with Ansible on Ubuntu20

with this yaml file you can only install your jenkins so if you need to install your plugins you need other yaml files too.

I've added my jenkins ssh configuration to `~/.ssh/config` so in the inventory I've only called the jenkins.

please let me know if you had any question
